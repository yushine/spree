## Major/New Features

### Versioned API

While we've had the ability to version our API we weren't making use of it.
Now that we're beginning to write a new API we've added a v1 namespace,
and default routing /api requests to use /api/v1.  The /api/v2 will be opt-in
until we feel it is complete, and have deprecated /api/v1 (likely for Spree 4).

### Dynamic prices depending on zone for VAT countries

The European Union has come up with new legislation requiring digital products
to be taxed using the customer's shipping address. In turn, this means that prices
have to be shown depending on the current order's tax zone.

Your order will always use the price for the current tax zone. After the address step in
the checkout process, the order will fetch the prices from the Variant again in order to
make sure they're correct.

For more information, see the [taxation guide](https://guides.spreecommerce.com/developer/taxation.html).

### Spree::Alert Removed

Spree Alert model has been removed, and will no longer ping alerts.spreecommerce.com
to check for notifications.

## Upgrade

### Update Gemfile & Run Migrations

### Other Gotchas

#### Make sure to v1 namespace custom rabl templates & overrides.

If your rabl templates reference others with extend you'll need to add the v1 namespace.

For example:

```ruby
extends 'spree/api/zones/show'
```

Becomes:

```ruby
extends 'spree/api/v1/zones/show'
```

#### Remove Spree::Config.check_for_spree_alerts

If you were disabling the alert checks you'll now want to remove this preference as it's no longer used.

#### Noteworthy Changes
